# College-student-enrollment-predictor
This machine learning model is designed to assist colleges in predicting the likelihood of a student enrolling after receiving an acceptance offer. By analyzing various factors and features, the model aims to provide insights that can help institutions better understand and anticipate student enrollment behavior.
Project Overview
This project includes three main Python scripts:

training.py: Used to create and train the model, and check its accuracy.
predicting.py: Used to make predictions for a whole CSV file.
app.py: A web portal to get individual predictions through a user-friendly interface.
Note: Due to privacy and sensitivity concerns, the actual dataset and feature details used in the training process are not provided. Users are encouraged to use their own datasets and features.

Files and Directories
training.py: Script to train the model.
predicting.py: Script to make batch predictions.
app.py: Flask web application for individual predictions.
templates/index.html: HTML template for the web interface.
